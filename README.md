# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets. The problem manifests as a blank screen or unexpected rendering behavior when rendering many items, often due to performance bottlenecks related to inefficient key management or slow rendering of individual items.

## Problem

The `FlatList` component struggles to render a large number of items efficiently if not properly configured.  This results in a blank screen, flickering, or incorrect rendering of list items.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing rendering and key management within the `FlatList` component.  This might involve techniques like:

* **Efficient `keyExtractor`:**  Ensuring a unique and fast key for each item is crucial.  Using the item's ID is a common practice.
* **Item optimization:** Reducing the complexity of each item's rendering.  Avoid complex calculations or unnecessary re-renders.
* **`windowSize` and `initialNumToRender`:** Adjust `windowSize` to control how many items are rendered initially and how many are buffered around the visible area.  `initialNumToRender` helps control initial rendering speed.
* **`removeClippedSubviews`:** This prop, enabled by default, can improve performance by removing items outside the visible area.
* **Virtualization:**  If issues persist, explore virtualized list libraries that provide more efficient rendering mechanisms.
