This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items. The error message might not be immediately clear, but it often manifests as blank space where the list should be, or unexpected rendering behavior.  The root cause is often related to inefficient rendering or key management within the `FlatList` component.  

Example of problematic code:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

In this case, `largeArray` could be an array with thousands of elements. If the `keyExtractor` is not properly defined or the rendering of each item is computationally expensive, the `FlatList` might fail to render correctly.
